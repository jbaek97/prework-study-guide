# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a UCLA Bootcamp student myself, I wanted to create a helpful study guide that other people and I could use to reinforce information learned within the Prework. Being a fast-pace course, often students could forget the crucial fundamentals that were learned in Prework. This study guide will hopefully alleviate this issue by providing quick access to information instead of forcing a student to sift through the Prework modules. In the process of making this study guide, I myself have come to learn basic lessons on tools I'll be using through-out the Bootcamp and the languages I'll encounter there.

## Usage

As stated before this website is meant to be a tool for UCLA Bootcamp students to use in order to bolster their Prework knowledge, so there isn't a wrong or right way of using it. For students who know what they're looking for, there is a homepage with four sections: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. These four sections have notes on the four topics, of which a student can peruse depending on his or her needs. For students who have no itinerary and simply want to learn or re-learn something, there is a JavaScript function that will randomly choose a topic for said student to study. Thils funciton can be accessed within the Chrome DevTools console.
